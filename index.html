        When the web was first developed in the early 1990s by Tim Berners-Lee, HTML was used to structure content, but
        it had no real way to define how that content should look. The web was purely functional, consisting of basic
        text and hyperlinks. All styling had to be done within the HTML document using attributes like &lt;font&gt; or
        &lt;b&gt;, making the web hard to maintain and visually unimpressive.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the web grew, it became clear that there needed to be a separation between content and design. Web designers
        wanted a way to create visually appealing and consistently styled pages without having to repeat the same style
        code over and over again in every HTML file.
      </p>
      <h3 id="birth">The Birth of CSS</h3>
      <p>
        CSS was proposed in 1994 by Håkon Wium Lie, a Norwegian web pioneer who, at the time, was working with Tim
        Berners-Lee at CERN. Lie envisioned a style sheet language that could work alongside HTML, allowing developers
        to define the presentation of their pages in a separate document.
      </p>
      <p>
        In December 1996, CSS1 became a W3C recommendation. It introduced fundamental concepts like selectors,
        properties, and values that allowed developers to apply styles to HTML elements. CSS1 wasn’t perfect and had
        limited browser support, but it marked the beginning of the web's visual evolution.
      </p>
      <h3>The Growth of CSS: From CSS1 to CSS3</h3>
      <p>
        As the web evolved, so did the needs of designers and developers. The original version of CSS couldn’t handle
        the
        complex layouts and designs that were becoming popular. This led to the release of CSS2 in 1998, which
        introduced
        several new features:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Positioning elements on the page (absolute, relative, fixed).</li>
        <li>Media types (print, screen).</li>
        <li>Z-index for layering elements.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>

        However, even with CSS2, browser compatibility was a significant challenge. Internet Explorer and Netscape, the
        dominant browsers of the time, each interpreted CSS differently, making cross-browser design a frustrating task.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the mid-2000s, CSS continued to evolve into CSS3, which was released in modules to address the specific needs
        of modern web development. CSS3 brought about many new features, including:
      </p>
      <ul>

        <li>Responsive design tools with media queries.</li>
        <li>Rounded corners, shadows, and gradients without using images.</li>
        <li>Animations and transitions.</li>
        <li>Flexbox and grid layouts for more complex designs.</li>
      </ul>
